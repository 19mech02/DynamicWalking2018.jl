    "\n",
    "Hopefully by now you believe us that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Julia is fast\n",
    "* Julia is expressive and powerful\n",
    "* There is a great ecosystem of packages which are easy to install and build upon\n",
    "* You can just write code without worrying about your build system\n",
    "\n",
    "But for the sake of fairness, we should mention a few caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "* While you can precompile parts of your code, complete ahead-of-time compilation is difficult\n",
    "* Real-time performance would require working around the garbage collector, which we don't have experience doing\n",
    "* The language is still very young, and things *will* change before we get to Julia 1.0"
